**Description**
IoT-Based Health Monitoring System Prototype using Arduino Uno

A prototype system for monitoring vital health data using Arduino and ESP8266, designed to send real-time sensor readings to the cloud and trigger alerts when thresholds are crossed.

What I Did
- This project is a personalized fork of a public health monitoring system. I adapted and studied it to explore:

- Real-time health tracking using basic medical sensors

- Wireless data transmission to ThingSpeak

- Emergency alert logic using MQTT (planned extension)

- Clean documentation and modular code design

Features
- Monitors heart rate and body temperature using sensors

- Sends data wirelessly to ThingSpeak IoT platform

- Displays live readings on an LCD screen

- Can be extended to trigger MQTT alerts during critical values

- Energy-efficient setup using solar power option (planned)

My Learning Goals
- Practice integrating multiple sensors in an embedded system

- Learn about wireless data logging and cloud dashboards

- Simulate real-time monitoring systems for remote healthcare

- Explore use cases similar to onboard health tracking in smart mobility/EVs

Hardware Components
- Arduino Uno

- ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module

- LM35 Temperature Sensor

- Pulse Sensor

- LCD 16x2

- Breadboard, Jumper Wires, 9V Power Source
